# Exercise 1: Three Logs

Learn how programs can display multiple messages in sequence and understand that **order matters**.

## 🎯 Goal

Write a JavaScript program that displays three messages in sequence to demonstrate how programs work step-by-step.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How to use multiple `console.log()` statements
- Understanding that programs execute line by line
- Why the order of statements matters

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open the file**: Look at the `script.js` file in this folder
2. **Write your code**: Add three `console.log()` statements that display messages about making a sandwich:
   - First message: Starting the process
   - Second message: A middle step
   - Third message: Finishing the process
3. **Test your code**: Run your script to see the messages in order:
   ```bash
   node exercises/02-sequence/01-three-logs/script.js
   ```
4. **Check with tests**: Run the automated test to verify your solution:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## 💡 Hints

- Use three separate `console.log()` statements
- Think about making a sandwich: what are the logical steps?
- Example messages could be about gathering ingredients, assembling, and finishing

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run your program, you should see three lines of output in order, like:
```
Getting bread and ingredients
Adding filling to the sandwich
Sandwich is ready to eat!
```

## 🤔 Think About It

- What happens if you change the order of your `console.log()` statements?
- Why does the order matter for the user experience?
- How does this relate to following a recipe or instructions?

## 🎉 Success!

Once your program works, you've successfully:
- ✅ Created a sequence of outputs
- ✅ Understood that programs execute line by line
- ✅ Learned why order matters in programming

Ready for the next exercise? Great work! 🚀
