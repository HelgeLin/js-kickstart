# Exercise: Day Plan

## 🎯 Goal
Practice writing sequential statements by creating a simple day plan.

## 📝 Instructions
Write a script that prints out 3 activities you plan to do today, in order.

Each activity should be printed on its own line.

## 💡 Example Output
```
Wake up and have breakfast
Go to programming class
Work on JavaScript exercises
```

## 🔧 How to Complete

**IMPORTANT: Run all commands from the main project folder (where package.json is), not from this exercise folder!**

1. Open `script.js` in this folder (`exercises/02-sequence/03-day-plan/script.js`)
2. Replace the placeholder text with your own activities
3. Test your script by running it directly:
   ```bash
   node exercises/02-sequence/03-day-plan/script.js
   ```
4. When it looks good, run the automated test:
   ```bash
   npm run test:one -- 02-sequence
   ```
5. If you get stuck, check `solution.js` in this folder for a working example

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Your script prints exactly 3 lines
- Each line describes an activity
- The activities are in a logical order

## 💭 Learning Focus
- Sequential execution of code
- Using `console.log()` to display output
- Understanding that code runs line by line, top to bottom
