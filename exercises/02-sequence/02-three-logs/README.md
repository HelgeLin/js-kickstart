> **This is a pen-and-paper exercise.** No coding required.

## 🎯 Goal
Understand that programs can display multiple messages in sequence and that **order matters**.

---

## 📝 Your Task

1. **Imagine a program that makes a sandwich.**  
   Write three messages it could display to show progress:

   Message 1: Släng på köttet på stekpannan
   Message 2: Låt köttet steka
   Message 3: Ta av köttet från stekpanna

2. **Does the order matter? Why?**  
   - What happens if the program displays the steps in the wrong order?
   Saker händer i fel ordning

3. **Predict the output:**  
   If a program displays these three messages:

   "Welcome to the calculator!"  
   "Please enter your numbers"  
   "Calculating result..."  

   - What do you think this program does?  
   - What would the user see on the screen?
   Jag skulle tro den räknar ut matte.
   Resultat

4. **Design your own three-message program.**  
   Choose a topic (cooking, sports, music, etc.).  
   Write three messages it would display in order.
